# dApp Toolkit

The [Radix dApp Toolkit](https://github.com/radixdlt/radix-dapp-toolkit/tree/main) wraps together the [Wallet SDK](https://github.com/radixdlt/wallet-sdk) and [Gateway SDK](gateway-sdk.md) along with a framework agnostic √ [Connect Button](https://github.com/radixdlt/connect-button) web component. Together they make it easy for developers to connect users and their Radix Wallet to their dApps.

## √ Connect Button

The √ Connect Button appears as a consistent, Radix-branded UI element that helps users identify your dApp website as a Radix dApp and compatible with the Radix Wallet – and it automatically provides a consistent user experience for users to connect with their wallet and see the current status of the connection between dApp and Radix Wallet.
