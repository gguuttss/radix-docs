# Gateway SDK

The TypeScript Gateway SDK provides a simple way of querying "state" on the Radix Network.

Web3 applications often need information about the current (or past) state of things on the Radix Network. Things such as:

-   What resources are currently held in a given account?
    
-   What is the configuration and metadata of a given resource?
    
-   What happened in a given transaction?
    
-   What is the status of a given component?
    

The Gateway SDK is a thin wrapper around the [Gateway API](network-apis), documentation for this API can be found [here](https://radix-babylon-gateway-api.redoc.ly/).

> Note if you are already using the Radix dApp Toolkit, it exposes an interface for this and you do not need to import seperately.
