# Backlog

-   **Higher Priority** contains items which are most likely to be tackled next
-   **General Items** contains items which have been reviewed and are slated to be implemented
-   **Acknowledged** contains items which either have not been reviewed, or have a lower priority

Items within a particular category are *not* sorted by priority!

  

## Higher Priority

-   Implicit Requirements (e.g. Global caller) index - to look up a global caller / public key etc from its hash

## General Items

-   Improved tracing through the Gateway service to improve debugging

*The backlog will be expanded once Gateway discovery completes.*

## Acknowledged

-   Aggregator failover - we recommend running parallel Gateways if this is a concern.
-   Exposing blueprint / method details - this is currently handled better by the Engine State API.
