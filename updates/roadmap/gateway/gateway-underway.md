# Underway

This page is a high-level summary of what is currently "top-of-mind" in this area for the development team.

Many business-as-usual tasks, like testing, fixes, research & design, and small features/optimizations don't rise to the level of being included here.

Items within sections are not ordered, and no timeline should be assumed for any particular item unless it has been explicitly communicated.

  

-   **1.11.0**
    -   **Improve Event Details** - Create new detailed events, to aid creation of other aggregation tools.
    -   **Add** **resource\_change** **filter to the transaction stream** - A more useful filter than the manifest resources filter.
-   **1.11.0**
    -   **Further collection storage reworks** \- Ensure that aggregator overhead is constant. Working through the separate collections in the Gateway.
    -   **JSON receipt storage investigation** \- Further looking at how we can decrease the size of the ledger transactions table.
