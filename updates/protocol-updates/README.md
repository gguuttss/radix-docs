# Protocol Updates

Protocol updates are named, major updates to the network, happening approximately two to three times a year. They are sometimes known as "hard forks" on other networks.

Protocol updates requires updates to the Node and Gateway for every node-runner of the network, and require the validator set to [signal readiness](node-protocol-updates).

The first protocol update was known as Genesis, and subsequent protocol updates follow an alphabetical sea creature naming scheme.

At the time of writing, the Babylon network has had the following updates:

-   [Genesis](genesis) (`babylon-genesis`) - The migration from Olympia. This brought the second generation Radix engine, with full smart contract support
-   [Anemone](anemone) (`anemone`) - Improved network time precision and various other small features/fixes
-   [Bottlenose](bottlenose) (`bottlenose`) - Account Locker blueprint and various other small features/fixes
-   [Cuttlefish](cuttlefish) (`cuttlefish` & `cuttlefish-part2`) - Subintents "pre-authorizations" and various other small features/fixes
