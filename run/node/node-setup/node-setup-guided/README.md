# Guided Setup (Recommended)

Welcome to the Radix node setup guide using the `babylonnode` CLI!

In this mode, you’ll use our Python CLI too  (`babylonnode`) for a straightforward, guided installation of Radix nodes on an Ubuntu host. We recommend this method for most people. This process works best on a fresh, dedicated machine (e.g. cloud instance).  
`babylonnode` is a versatile tool that can not only assist in setting up a node and related tools, but also helps to manage it afterwards.

> This script has been tested on [Ubuntu 22.04.2.0 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/), and requires Python version 3 to run (if you don’t have an up-to-date version installed, follow the guide [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu)).
> 
> The CLI does not support Windows at the moment.

Before you begin, please read the [Node Setup Introduction](../README.md), if you haven’t done so yet.
